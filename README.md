# Java Mini Projects

A collection of Java mini projects for learning and practice. Each project demonstrates different programming concepts and game logic.

## Projects

| Project | Game Name | Description | Folder |
|---------|-----------|-------------|--------|
| **miniProject0** | Tic Tac Toe | Two-player classic game with 3x3 grid | `miniProject0/` |
| **miniProject1** | Advanced Memory Game | Multi-difficulty memory card matching game | `miniProject1/` |
| **miniProject2** | Library Management System | Switch-based book and student management system | `miniProject2/` |

## Quick Start

Each project can be run independently. Navigate to the project folder and follow these steps:

### Generic Compilation
```bash
cd miniProjectX
javac *.java
```

### Run Specific Project

**miniProject0 (Tic Tac Toe):**
```bash
cd miniProject0
javac TicTacToe.java
java TicTacToe
```

**miniProject1 (Advanced Memory Game):**
```bash
cd miniProject1
javac *.java
java MemoryGame
```

**miniProject2 (Library Management System):**
```bash
cd miniProject2
javac *.java
java Library
```

## Project Details

Each project has its own `README.md` with detailed documentation, including:
- Game rules and mechanics
- How to play instructions
- Features and gameplay examples
- Class structure and design

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or higher

## Project Progression

These projects are organized by progression level:
- **miniProject0**: Classic two-player game (Tic Tac Toe)
- **miniProject1**: Single-player memory challenge with multiple difficulty levels
- **miniProject2**: Multi-user system with data management and operations

## Technologies Used

- Java
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Data Structures (Arrays, ArrayLists)
- Control Flow (Loops, Switch Statements, Conditionals)
- Game Logic Implementation
